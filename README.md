# Rubik's Cube 2D

The first major progam that I ever built was a rubik's cube simulation in python. It is written in python 2 using the turtle library for graphics. You can view it here. As you can see, this program has many ineffeciencies. This program is a good reference for where I started out as a programmer.

## Getting Started

To experiment with this project, you will need python 2 and the turtle library. Python can be installed from the python website or using your package manager if you are on a linux distribution. Turtle should be installed with python 2.

Clone this repository and run:
```
python main.py
```
